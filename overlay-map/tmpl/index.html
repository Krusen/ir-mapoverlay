		## About

		A stylized track map showing all cars and their position (car number if no time/position is set) on track or in pits. Tracks are based on [RivalTracker by Sam Hazim](https://github.com/SamHazim/RivalTracker) with many of them redrawn and missing tracks for iRacing added.

		## Setup

		1. Go to [Settings](#/settings) page
		2. Copy generated **CLR Browser URL**
		3. In OBS add new **CLR Browser** layer, and paste it in **URL**
		4. Set **Dimensions** to `420x324px`

		   **^ This is important, or the map might be cut off ^**
		5. Go to **CSS** tab and replace all with:
		   ```css
		   body {
		   	background: inherit !important;
		   }
		   ```
		   This will make background transparent

		## Notice

		This overlay can be very demanding on CPU in some cases. If you are running multiple instances of the overlay, especially with large grids, it may result in very slow or no updates of the map.

		You might try to reduce the FPS in settings or refresh (enable/disable) the overlay then. This fixes the issue in most *but not all* cases.

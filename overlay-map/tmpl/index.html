		## About

		A stylized track map showing all cars and their position (car number if no time/position is set) on track or in pits. Tracks are based on [RivalTracker by Sam Hazim](https://github.com/SamHazim/RivalTracker) with many of them redrawn and missing tracks for iRacing added.

		## Setup

		1. Go to [Settings](#/settings) page
		2. Copy generated **CLR Browser URL**
		3. In OBS add new **CLR Browser** layer, and paste it in **URL**
		4. Set **Dimensions** to 420x324px
		5. Go to **CSS** tab and replace all with:
		   ```css
		   body {
		   	background: inherit !important;
		   }
		   ```
		   This will make background transparent
